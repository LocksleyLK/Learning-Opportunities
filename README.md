# Learning-Opportunities

## Objective
The goal of this repository is to be a one-stop shop to find all of the upskilling initiatives companies like Microsoft and Google are providing during the Covid-19 Pandemic. These resources are remote, valuable, and (mostly) free!

## How You Can Help
One thing you can do right now is share this with anyone who you think can benefit from it. These learning resources are fantastic, and I believe anyone can benefit from them. Also, if you find opportunities that are not listed here, please help by contributing to this repository. Thank you for your help!
